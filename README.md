In this lab I created a Java GUI Calculator. It contains buttons that are clickable and is able to compute/display solutions according to user input.
The GUI will have a panel of graphic buttons (filled circles) with string labels. When pressed, the graphic button background will change color indicating the button is currently pressed. When the mouse is released, the background will return to its original color. Also, the string value in the button will be concatenated to the TextField at the top of the GUI. There will be additional command Buttons at the bottom of the GUI with functionality described below.
